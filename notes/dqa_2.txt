The Sensible and the Intelligible

The sensible is known through the senses, the intelligible through reason. The sensible is corporeal, the intelligible incorporeal. Augustine will maintain that the intelligible is better known through reason, than the sensible is through the senses. Not only is there a difference in our epistemic access to these, but there is an evaluative difference between them as well. Intelligible things, like the virtue of justice, are more important than sensible things, like a visible tree.

Two challenges

At this point the central argument of the dialogue has been made. More specifically, Augustine has completed his negative and positive cases. That is to say, Augustine has argued that just because something is incorporeal does not mean that it is less real or less valuable than something corporeal. Moreover, Augustine has argued that the soul must be incorporeal because it possesses powers that corporeal extended things lack. And the incorporeal powers of the soul are either more valuable than their corporeal counterparts or at least more valuable than the corporeal objects of their activity. Evodius accepts that Augustine has established this. What is raised is less objections per se to Augustine's negative and postive case than certain residual puzzles or challenges. There are two:

1. If the soul is inextended, how is it that the soul grows over time as the body grows? (DQA 15.26–22)
2. If the soul is inextended, then it is not extended throughout the body. But if the soul is not extended throughout the body, then how can it sense a stimulus on any and every part of the body? (DQA 23–)

Bigger and Better

Augustine begins DQA 16 by emphasizing the distinction between bigger and better, between something greater in extent (in the clumsy technical vocabulary I introduced, greater in extensive magnitude) and something greater in power or virtue (greater in virtual magnitude). A circle is greater than a square not because it is greater in extent, but because it manifests greater equality among its parts (every point on the surface of a circle is equidistant from itse center). It is greater, not in virtue of its quality or extensive magnitude, but in virtue of equality among its parts because of its symmetrical form.

Earlier, Augustine followed the Eleatic Visitor's lead in using the virtue of justice to argue two things. First, that just because something is incorporeal does not mean that it is not real. Second, something can be of great value without being great in extent. Something can be better without being bigger. This prompts Augustine to reflect on the nature of virtue and extend these points further. 

The circle is superior to the square not because of greater quantity but greater equality. Virtue is itself a kind of equality, an equality of life consistently in harmony with reason. Virtue is greater than some other state of the soul not because it is greater in extent, but because it is greater in being harmoniously balanced with reason and so to that extent approaches the divine.
